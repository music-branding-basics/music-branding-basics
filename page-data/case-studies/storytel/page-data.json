The company offers a subscription-based service in which customers can listen to audiobooks and read ebooks on their mobile phones.\\nStorytel's aesthetic profile was refreshed in 2019 and a new tone in the brand's expression was established. Because music branding is such a valuable service, it was an obvious next step in the branding process. A major problem awaited: how could Storytel design an audio branding universe that would express the business and its service while also working globally, given the diversity of cultures, languages, and music?

They could make synthetic musical instruments out of voices by stacking and processing them in various ways. Warm synth pads and whistling were made by extending, adjusting, and filtering the voices. The result produced friendly, lovely choirs by granularizing the vocals. A \\\"dooh-like\\\" choir sound was developed that could play whimsical tunes by layering individual stories together.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"They began to construct the sound of the brand -the Storytel audio universe\\u2013 with nothing but the recorded voices of Storytel's audiobook narrators.

All of this was put into a digital audio branding platform, complete with all of the unique sounds and logos, as well as special synthesizer patches, so Storytel could make fresh audio branded music anytime they needed it.
