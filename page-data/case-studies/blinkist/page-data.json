This stage consisted of research, as well as several workshops that brought together stakeholders from across our company.

The toolkit contains every element and layer of the compositions that make up our audio brand DNA, providing a great deal of flexibility to apply the toolkit creatively, dynamically, and distinctively to any current or future touchpoint. The process of creating the toolkit also allowed and encouraged the audio team at Blinkist to become intimately familiar with the audio brand\\u2019s functionality.
