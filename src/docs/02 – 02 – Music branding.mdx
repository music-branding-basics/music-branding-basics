Before we deep dive into the definition of music branding, I must clarify why this body of work refers to music branding with this **specific terminology** and what choices I have taken in order to align with the industry scenario of the time in which this publication is written.

There seems to be some **confusion in the academic world and in the industry** right now **on terminology**. We hear different terms that are used and refer to the same or different things depending on who is using them, how and where you hear them. An attempt to better define this practice was initiated in 2016 by Herzog, Lepa, Egermann, Schoenrock & Steffens with *Towards a Common Terminology for Music Branding Campaigns (MBET)*[^1]. In their paper they refer to the practice as **music branding**, even though we might have heard different terms such as: **audio branding, sonic branding**, acoustic branding, acoustic brand management, audio marketing, sound marketing or acoustic brand communication. Obviously, their work is not limited to choosing an **umbrella term** for the practice, but it also expands to different terminologies in music categorization, specifically tailored to music branding. Nevertheless, they believe that the term can be **comprehensive and specific enough to talk about the whole practice**.

<Quote author="Martin Herzoga">
"For a long time, sound and music have been recognised as important means for communication in marketing under the label of sonic branding, audio branding, or sound branding. The approved ability of music and sound to affect listeners emotionally and convey socio-cultural meaning and values is the main reason why marketing practitioners increasingly rely on music as a powerful channel for brand communication. Focusing specifically on music as a central means for communicating brand identity, we will only use the term music branding throughout this work."
</Quote>

In the wake of their decision and given the work that Herzoga et al. have initiated in order to bring a clear terminology in the realm of music branding, **I have decided to adopt their terminology** and will only refer to the practice as music branding, in this work. Of course, you might still find the words sonic, acoustic and audio branding in interviews, citation and online resources of this work.

A great starting point for a **definition of music branding** is the **International Sound Awards (ISA)**. The association’s goal is to promote innovative, smart and useful sound projects, products and services that contribute to their motto: Make The World Sound Better!

They are also a great point of reference for major music branding companies around the world. Here’s their definition of music branding:

**Audio Branding describes the process of brand development and brand management by use of audible elements within the framework of brand communication**. It is part of **multi-sensory brand communication** and **holistic brand design**. Audio Branding aims at **building solidly a brand sound** that represents the **identity and values** of a brand in a distinctive manner. The audio logo, branded functional sounds, brand music or the brand voice are characteristic elements of Audio Branding.[^2]

Or, in easier terms by PHMG:

“Put simply, **audio branding is the use of sound to define, reinforce and strengthen a company's identity**. Music, voice artistry, copy and sonic logos all play their part in getting a business name heard, and companies can deploy one, all, or a combination of these elements in various auditory channels.”[^3]

And some even say that “sound branding is the umbrella term for the process of making brands (or components of brands) audible.”[^4]

As you can see there is a lot of terminology all over the place, but let us focus on the last definition: “**the process of making brands audible**”. The **audible perception of the brand** is controlled and conveyed through permanent mental connections. Companies' corporate identities, which were previously only visible visually, are now **complete with sound**. The brand's ability to successfully position sound in the foreground or background of entrepreneurial initiatives is a key distinguishing factor. Music branding is **an important aspect of communication** since it allows you to **stand out from the crowd**; it establishes a strong audible link between your brand and your target audience.

Brands have spent a lot of time and money on visual branding so far, but **sound hasn't been seen as a brand element that has to be investigated**. The rise of new media and devices with built-in audio delivery, such as **podcasts, streaming media, and smartphones**, extends the possibilities for audio branding while simultaneously raising the risk of noise pollution and cacophony. **Unsystematic and unstructured deployment of audio stimuli often compromises the effectiveness and efficiency of brand communication**. Audio branding may help to improve a brand's communication and create a better-sounding environment.

The International Sound Awards have compiled a list of different categories where sound can play an important role and transform the experience of the consumer with a specific brand.

1. **Product**: all designs involving digital or acoustic (mechanical) product sound. Audio Software and Hardware, Musical Instruments, Functional Sound, Sonic User Interface, 3D-Sound, Game Sound, Auditory Display, Sonification, Augmented (Sound) Reality, Virtual (Sound) Reality.

2. **Research & Development**: outstanding scientific work and developments. Studies should be substantially completed. Development should have reached prototype status with proof of concept.
3. **Life & Society**:
    1. **Soundscapes and Ambient Sound**: acoustic concepts and design for public spaces, e.g. exhibitions, museums, airports, train stations, hospitals, shopping malls etc.

    2. **Health**: concepts and solutions to enhance health and well-being.

    3. **Universal Design**: sound design concepts for products, services, buildings and environments that contribute to inclusion and accessibility as well as to the enjoyment of life through aesthetic expression.

    4. **Social & Culture**: intelligent and innovative concepts and solutions that make an important contribution to society and culture.

    5. **Noise Protection**: projects for noise protection and the preservation of silence as well as intelligent and innovative application in products and services.
4. **Corporate Communications**:

    1. **Audio Marketing**: marketing projects that integrate sound in an essential way. In contrast to audio branding, the sound does not have to serve brand-building purposes. The projects should demonstrate the advantage of an intelligent and innovative application of sound.

    2. **Audio Branding**: audio branding cases that show a strategic branding approach and a clear audio branding methodology.

5. **Voice and Audio Dialogue**: voice Control, Interactive Voice Response (IVR), Call Management, Text to Speech Systems (TTS), Speech Recognition etc.

6. **Services and Sound Start-ups**: innovative sound and music services. Convincing sound and music business models by start-ups.

7. **Sound Art**: intelligent and innovative projects that contribute to the mission “Make the world sound better!”

Music and sound are **beneficial to all of these sectors** and they serve the purpose of **differentiating one brand from another**. The range of applications in music branding represents a great challenge and potential confusion in its definition.


<Conclusion>
Even so, the main takeaway of the definition of music branding is that it helps the brand in communicating itself through **a series of audible assets**. It is part of the multi-sensorial communication of a brand and a **holistic vision of corporate design**. Music branding aims at building the foundation of the sound of a brand that will represent its identity and values in a distinct way.
