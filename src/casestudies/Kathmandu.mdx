What do you get when you mix a unique bird call, catchy melodies from wooden instruments and the sound of people exploring the outdoors?

For outdoor brand Kathmandu, Massive Music developed an iconic, memorable and distinctive sonic identity as part of a long-term strategy. The aim? To drive the brand audio DNA across all relevant touchpoints while delivering an emotional boost to consumers.

The sound of Kathmandu needed to:
- Embody the brand values of ‘joyful, spontaneous, carefree’
- Be resonant with contemporary music culture and appeal to outdoor urban millennial
- Highlight the new brand mission of Kathmandu to ‘get people out there’
- Be ownable to the brand and distinct from competitors
