An holistic audio identity designed to scale with USA Today’s modern evolution.

Amidst a digital transformation, USA Today engaged Audio UX® to create an instantly recognizable sound that would reinforce the brand identity and connect future experiences.

As the primary expression of the USA Today audio identity, the Audio Logo is a poignant and concise auditory signature.
As an analog to the visual identity, a sound designed “Point” represents the blue circle in the USA Today logo.
Recordings of an American Flag waving creates a unique texture functioning as an homage to the core brand values.

To facilitate USA Today’s digital transformation, the audio identity was designed to be easily reformed and integrated into any future touchpoint.
The strategy was to build a decentralized identity made of a modular system of audio components.

Starting with an audible brand manifesto, a series of long-form musical executions that holistically represent the USA Today brand identity to be used by content teams across the organization was developed.
