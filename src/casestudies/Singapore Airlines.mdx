How do you translate the new visual world of SIA - the vibrant colourful melange of the Batik - into a new sound world for the brand?

DLMDD looked at synaethesia - the neurological trait or condition that results in a joining or merging of senses that aren't normally connected.
In simple terms, composers and creators who hear sounds when they see colours.
Duke Ellington, Pharrell and even David Hockney are all synesthetes.

But synaesthesia is very personal. One person's green could be the sound of a G major chord. Another's could be a Bb diminished. DLMDD needed something more universal.
All colours have frequencies and so do sounds. They started building an instrument with the technologies to connect the two.

The result was an interactive instrument that could be played by anyone, anywhere. DLMDD chose a world- class composer to produce a symphony of sound using the instrument.
Where a composer would usually sit down at the piano to write, in this case the composer would sit down with the Batik instrument to produce the sound of Singapore Airlines.
