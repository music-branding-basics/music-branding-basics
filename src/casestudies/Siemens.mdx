Under the brand claim "Ingenuity for life", Siemens has developed a new brand sound together with why do birds. The company and the people are at the center of the brand positioning and the new brand sound connects both worlds: the engineering art and the inventiveness, the "ingenuity" and the customer benefit "life". The sound is part of the holistic approach to brand management of Siemens, which is a pioneer in the use of sound in branding.
