MassiveMusic worked with DesignStudio and DixonBaxi to create the sonic branding for the Premier League, the world’s most watched football league, after the league decided it needed to inject more personality into its overall brand following research.

The sonic identity was defined by researching the age ranges and musical preferences of Premier League fans and mapping out the identity through a mix of sound. Then a bold electro sound was created, based on a unique mix of orchestra and stadium field recordings, with a bassline sampled from anthems that are played before football games.

The end result was a theme tune that embodied the Premier League’s DNA, with 11 different arrangements that could be used across touchpoints, as well as an anthem that would be played before matches. The track was also used in FIFA17, the world’s No.1 football game, and was released as a single on all digital music platforms following consumer demand.
