Philips is a Dutch technology company that is headquartered in Amsterdam. It is a diversified company that is active in the sectors of healthcare, lighting, and consumer electronics. Philips is one of the largest electronics companies in the world and has over 100,000 employees in more than 60 countries.

With Philips now focusing in the area of healthcare, the challenge for MassiveMusic was to come up with a broad yet cohesive spectrum of sounds that could support their communication. Not only, all of their different types of products and digital services had to be taken into account.

Philips now has a new emotive and contemporary sonic identity, a recognisable signature that brings consistency across all global markets in every consumer interaction with the brand.
