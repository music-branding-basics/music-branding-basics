Geberit is a Swiss company that manufactures and sells sanitary products. The company was founded in 1869 and is headquartered in Jona, Switzerland. Geberit has over 9,000 employees, and it operates in over 40 countries. The company's products include toilets, sinks, showers, and other bathroom fixtures.

In 2020, Geberit decided to embark on a transformation journey and started thinking about the sound of the brand. They asked AMP sound branding to give a voice to their business.

The company started with the creation of an original music composition, the brand's theme, titled Water (You Make Me Feel Home) and performed by Fume & Comette.

This track embodies the essence of the brand, feeling like home, at ease, with the perfect bathroom experience.

The sound logo of the Geberit Group has a fascinating origin and it tells the story of evolution. AMP recorded sounds inside the Geberit test laboratories and embedded them into the sound identity. The key of this concept was to connect the brand directly to their products.

Starting from the core melody of Water (You Make Me Feel Home) they extracted the 4 key melody notes and fused them together with the Geberit aura sound, precision machinery sound and water flushing down the toilet. Although the perception of this peculiar sound might be attenuated by mixing, it still conveys the perfect bathroom experience.

From there, Geberit expanded and adapted their core melody to every piece of advertisement and corporate video they could find.

In May of 2020, Geberit released their corporate movie. It had strong rhythms and an energetic feel to it while maintaining the classical “You make me feel harmony”.

Other adaptations across campaigns and corporate material continue to be deployed every now and then, making full use of the corporate sound that now reflects the brand.
